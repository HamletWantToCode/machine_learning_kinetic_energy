    "## Fit the function\n",
    "Suppose we have some data, and would like to find the underlying relationship between those data, a frequently used method is **function fitting**, we can build function based on polynomials or splines. However, the function we built may not perfectly fit all of the data, errors due to the noise inside or the lack of knowledge about the underlying principals will always appear. Therefore, to get best performance, the function we used to fit the data should give us the least error, the function fitting problem in this case can be stated as follows:\n",
